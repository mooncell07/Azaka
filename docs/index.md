# Welcome

Hi and welcome to the documentation of Azaka, an API Wrapper around VNDB API.

## Features

- **Fully Asynchronous** - Everything which poses a threat of blocking the I/O for a significant amount of time is async.
- **Caching** - Azaka supports caching responses, which saves us from getting throttled quickly!
- **Easy to Use** - Azaka provides a really easy to use interface for creating complex commands and a bunch of ready-made presets for those in hurry.
- **Global Exception handling** - Azaka provides utility for handling command errors globally to save you from try-except hell! Also it does alot behind the screen to save you from sending and receiving bad stuff anyways!
- **No Dependency requirement** - No third party dependency is required to do anything in entire library.
